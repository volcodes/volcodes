## 👋 Hi, I’m @volcodes (Mehmet)

I'm a **Software Specialist** based in Berlin, originally from Turkey. 
With over 10 years of experience building modern, user-focused **web** applications, 
I specialize in **JavaScript, Vue, Nuxt, React**, and the broader frontend ecosystem. I combine strong engineering skills with a deep interest in psychology, awareness, and human-centered design.

---

### 👀 I’m interested in:
- Frontend architecture, design systems, design patterns, OOP, SOLID, and web performance
- Developer experience (DX) and tooling
- Cloud infrastructure & DevOps (AWS, Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes)
- Software consulting & digital transformation strategy
- Psychology, neurology, and mental models for better software and better teams

---

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Cloud-native deployments with AWS S3, CloudFront, and Route 53
- Infrastructure as code (Terraform, Pulumi)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows
- Kubernetes for scalable, production-ready environments
- Advanced security topics (JWT, cookies, OAuth, CORS)

---

### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- 🚀 **Modern web apps** using Vue 3, Nuxt 3, React, or hybrid stacks—especially those focused on speed, accessibility, and exceptional user experience.
- 🧠 **Developer experience (DX) tooling**—improving build systems, CI/CD pipelines, or internal tools that reduce friction for engineering teams.
- 🧩 **Frontend system design**—design systems, component libraries, and architecture planning that scale across teams and products.
- 📊 **Dashboards or analytics UIs**—data-driven tools where clarity and UX drive value.
- ☁️ **Cloud-native projects**—deployments using AWS (S3, CloudFront, Route53), with infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Pulumi) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).
- 🧪 **Security-first apps**—projects involving authentication, authorization, or modern web security practices (OAuth, JWT, cookie/session management).
- 🧭 **Technical mentoring or team onboarding initiatives**—helping engineers ramp up fast, structure complex systems, or refactor legacy codebases.
- 🧠 **Consulting-style side projects**—where I can bridge engineering and strategy to uncover hidden inefficiencies or elevate the product/architecture.
