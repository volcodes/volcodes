## 👋 Hi, I’m Mehmet

I'm a **Software Specialist** based in Berlin. 
With over 10 years of experience building modern, user-focused **web** applications, 
I specialize in **JavaScript, Vue, Nuxt**, feel comfortable working with technologies such as Node.js, React, Next.js and the broader frontend and backend ecosystem. I combine strong programming skills with a deep interest in psychology, awareness, and human-centered design.


### 🌱 Currently learning:
- Cloud-native topics: AWS, S3, EC2, Elasticsearch, Lambda Functions, CloudFront, Route 53
- Infrastructure as code (Terraform, Pulumi, Internet and Network)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows
- Kubernetes for scalable, production-ready environments. 
- Advanced security topics (JWT, cookies, OAuth, CORS)
- Software Architecture: Monolithic, Modular, Event-Driven, Microservices, Serverless and Modular

### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- 🏗️ **Frontend application architecture discussions** experienced in MVVM, MVC, Component-Based and Cloud-Native envoirements.
- 🚀 **Modern web apps** using Vue, Nuxt, React, or hybrid stacks.
- 🧠 **Developer experience (DX) tooling**—empowering build systems and CI/CD pipelines with Node.js.
- 🧩 **Frontend system design**—design systems, component libraries.
- ☁️ **Cloud-native projects**—deployments using AWS (S3, CloudFront, Route53), with infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Pulumi) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).
- 🧪 **Security-first apps**—projects involving authentication, authorization, or modern web security practices (OAuth, JWT, cookie/session management).
- 🧭 **Technical mentoring or team onboarding initiatives**—helping engineers ramp up fast, structure complex systems, or refactor legacy codebases.
